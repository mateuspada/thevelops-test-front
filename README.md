# thevelops-test-front

It's an REACT App created as a test.
It was created using create-react-app. 

All the components that I create are inside the /src/components folder. I used react-materialize to draw  them, and I create the routes following the requisite document.

Start the API (thevelops-test-back) before run this project.

To start the project, just use the NPM command - npm start.

I decided to use JWT, and I'm storing it in the local browser storage.

The Components Profile, ProfileEdit and ProfileChangePass are protected by Auth, so you cannot acces them without login in the system.

PS: I've never used react before, and it's my first app using it :)
